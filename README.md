# File Disassembler
Disassemble a text file into enormous amount of small files, and optionally reassemble it back (depend on the length of your file, the resulting file size could be up to 100 times) (also because of this, the disassembling speed is kind of slow)

**DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DISASSEMBLE ANY NON TEXT FILES - This is a one way trip for non text files**, this script is not able to reassemble them once the file is disassembled

## Prerequistes
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer
* NPM or Yarn (By default , NPM is installed)

## Preparation
1. Install dependencies by `npm install` or `yarn`

## Running the Disassembler

### Disassembling:
> Note: <> are required arguments, while [] are optional arguments

To disassemble a file, use the following command
```
$ npm run break <filename>
```
This will generate a folder called `output` in the root directory, and there lies all the shattered files. If you wish to zip it, run
```
$ npm run zip [disassembled-folder-path] [export-zip-file-path]
```
By default , it will zip the `output/` folder and create an `output.zip` zip file if you did not provide the path

### Assembling:
To reassemble a file, use the following command
```
$ npm run restore [disassembled-folder-path] [restored-file-extension]
```
If you did not specify the disassembled folder paht and restored file export path, the command will restore the disassembled file inside `output/` folder into `output.txt`
